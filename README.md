# Cointracker-Assessment

Thank you for taking the time out to have a look at this work.
The second part of this project can be run within a python notebook. I used Google Colab to write the code itself.
The third part of this project was done using Java/Springboot as a maven project. The file can be opened on Intellij by opening the pom.xml file as a project. I do apologise for not making this part of the project fully functional. I tried to set up most of the architectural components however, as explained in my email, I was unable to dedicate enough time near the end of the day to finish this off. I do appreciate being considered for this role.
